# General Tips

1. You may need to use more than one tool to achieve a given control.
   - E.g. more than one linter, or more than one breaking change check tool. 
2. Start by doing an API artifact value stream mapping and focusing on the areas of your value stream that have the greatest risk.
   - The controls discussed in this talk are not exhaustive.
3. Have an API platform team to support this.
4. Provide self-service documentation for teams on how to use the tools (or where to find their documentation).
5. Speed thrills. Keep your API artifact pipeline fast, for fast feedback cycles. 
6. Treat your API artifacts as a versioned deployable package. Store them in an artifact repository or API registry.
7. Start small - with a simple API style guide, or with simple tools. Then grow it.

# Conclusion
1.  If you are building lots of APIs, consider these four controls in your API delivery process.
     - API Consistency controls / Linting
     - Breaking Change Controls
     - API Conformance Controls
     - Code Generation Controls
2. You may need to use more than one tool for each control. Experiment with the tools. 
3. The goal is to reduce risk and improve the value of your API.
